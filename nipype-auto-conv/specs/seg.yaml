# This file is used to manually specify the semi-automatic conversion of
# 'nipype.interfaces.afni.preprocess.Seg' from Nipype to Pydra.
#
# Please fill-in/edit the fields below where appropriate
#
# Inputs
# ------
# in_file : file
#    ANAT is the volume to segment
# mask : traitcompound
#    only non-zero voxels in mask are analyzed. mask can either be a dataset or the string "AUTO" which would use AFNI's automask function to create the mask.
# blur_meth : enum
#    set the blurring method for bias field estimation
# bias_fwhm : float
#    The amount of blurring used when estimating the field bias with the Wells method
# classes : str
#    CLASS_STRING is a semicolon delimited string of class labels
# bmrf : float
#    Weighting factor controlling spatial homogeneity of the classifications
# bias_classes : str
#    A semicolon delimited string of classes that contribute to the estimation of the bias field
# prefix : str
#    the prefix for the output folder containing all output volumes
# mixfrac : str
#    MIXFRAC sets up the volume-wide (within mask) tissue fractions while initializing the segmentation (see IGNORE for exception)
# mixfloor : float
#    Set the minimum value for any class's mixing fraction
# main_N : int
#    Number of iterations to perform.
# args : str
#    Additional parameters to the command
# environ : dict
#    Environment variables
#
# Outputs
# -------
# out_file : file
#    output file
#
# Docs
# ----
# 3dSeg segments brain volumes into tissue classes. The program allows
#     for adding a variety of global and voxelwise priors. However for the
#     moment, only mixing fractions and MRF are documented.
# 
#     For complete details, see the `3dSeg Documentation.

#     Examples
#     --------
#     >>> from nipype.interfaces.afni import preprocess

#     >>> seg.inputs.mask = 'AUTO'
#     >>> seg.cmdline
#     '3dSeg -mask AUTO -anat structural.nii'
#     >>> res = seg.run()  # doctest: +SKIP

  types:
  # dict[str, type] - override inferred types (use "mime-like" string for file-format types,
  # e.g. 'medimage/nifti-gz'). For most fields the type will be correctly inferred
  # from the nipype interface, but you may want to be more specific, particularly

  # passed to the field in the automatically generated unittests.

  metadata:
  # dict[str, dict[str, any]] - additional metadata to set on any of the input fields (e.g. out_file: position: 1)

  callables:
  # dict[str, str] - names of methods/callable classes defined in the adjacent `*_callables.py`
  # to set to the `callable` attribute of output fields
  templates:
  # dict[str, str] - `output_file_template` values to be provided to output fields
  requirements:
  # dict[str, list[str]] - input fields that are required to be provided for the output field to be present
tests:
- inputs:
  # dict[str, str] - values to provide to inputs fields in the task initialisation
  # (if not specified, will try to choose a sensible value)
    in_file:
    mask: '"AUTO"'
  imports:
  # list[nipype2pydra.task.importstatement] - list import statements required by the test, with each list item

  expected_outputs:
  # dict[str, str] - expected values for selected outputs, noting that tests will typically
  # be terminated before they complete for time-saving reasons, and therefore
  # these values will be ignored, when running in CI
  timeout: 10
  # int - the value to set for the timeout in the generated test, 
  # after which the test will be considered to have been initialised 
  # successfully. Set to 0 to disable the timeout (warning, this could
  # lead to the unittests taking a very long time to complete)
  xfail: true
  # bool - whether the unittest is expected to fail or not. Set to false
  # when you are satisfied with the edits you have made to this file
doctests:
- cmdline: 3dSeg -mask AUTO -anat structural.nii
  # str - the expected cmdline output
  inputs:
  # dict[str, str] - name-value pairs for inputs to be provided to the doctest.
  # If the field is of file-format type and the value is None, then the
  # '.mock()' method of the corresponding class is used instead.

  # str - any doctest directive to place on the cmdline call, e.g. # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
