# This file is used to manually specify the semi-automatic conversion of
# 'nipype.interfaces.afni.utils.Dot' from Nipype to Pydra.
#
# Please fill-in/edit the fields below where appropriate
#
# Inputs
# ------
# in_files : list
#    list of input files, possibly with subbrick selectors
# out_file : file
#    collect output to a file
# mask : file
#    Use this dataset as a mask
# mrange : tuple
#    Means to further restrict the voxels from 'mset' so thatonly those mask values within this range (inclusive) willbe used.
# demean : bool
#    Remove the mean from each volume prior to computing the correlation
# docor : bool
#    Return the correlation coefficient (default).
# dodot : bool
#    Return the dot product (unscaled).
# docoef : bool
#    Return the least square fit coefficients {{a,b}} so that dset2 is approximately a + b\*dset1
# dosums : bool
#    Return the 6 numbers xbar=<x> ybar=<y> <(x-xbar)^2> <(y-ybar)^2> <(x-xbar)(y-ybar)> and the correlation coefficient.
# dodice : bool
#    Return the Dice coefficient (the Sorensen-Dice index).
# doeta2 : bool
#    Return eta-squared (Cohen, NeuroImage 2008).
# full : bool
#    Compute the whole matrix. A waste of time, but handy for parsing.
# show_labels : bool
#    Print sub-brick labels to help identify what is being correlated. This option is useful whenyou have more than 2 sub-bricks at input.
# upper : bool
#    Compute upper triangular matrix
# num_threads : int
#    set number of threads
# outputtype : enum
#    AFNI output filetype
# args : str
#    Additional parameters to the command
# environ : dict
#    Environment variables
#
# Outputs
# -------
# out_file : file
#    output file
#
# Docs
# ----
# Correlation coefficient between sub-brick pairs.
#     All datasets in in_files list will be concatenated.
#     You can use sub-brick selectors in the file specification.
# 
#     .. warning::
# 
#         This program is not efficient when more than two subbricks are input.
#
